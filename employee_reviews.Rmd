Here are some basic information about R Notebook:

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

###A dataframe that contains the following information for each company
###The number of reviews

###Displaying the pros and cons of the three most helpful reviews (based on the helpful count).



```{r}
  
  # Sort the data according to the helpful counts
  data <- arrange(data,desc(helpful.count))
  
  # Get the Top 3 Pros and Cons of Each by using indexes

###Displaying a dataframe that contains the number of reviews (for all companies) for each month of each year.

```{r}


# Make a copy of the orriginal Data Frame
newData1 <- data
# Trim any Leading white space
newData1$dates <- trimws(newData1$dates)

# Format the data back to its original state ( (abriviated)month , date, year )
newData1$dates <- as.Date(newData1$dates, format = "%b %d, %Y")


newData1 <- mutate(newData1, Year = format(dates, "%Y"))
newData1 <- mutate(newData1, Month = format(dates, "%m"))
# Group data by Year and Month 
review <- group_by(newData1, Year, Month)
# Summarize the grouped data 
review <- summarise(review, number=n())

# Print the first 6 rows of the DF
print(head(review) , 6)

# class(newData1$dates) # to check the data type of dates
```


###Amazon has the most number of reviews. Out of all the reviews for Amazon, 
###how many reviews are given by current employee?  
###How many reviews are given by Former employee? 

```{r}


# arrange orriginal DF according to company name and stor it inside a new DF
sorted_data_byComp <- arrange(data, company)

#Get the reviews form amazon only ( Recall from Task #1, Amazon had a count of 26430)
amazon_review <- head(sorted_data_byComp, 26430)

# Arrange by Job Title
amazon_review <- arrange(amazon_review, job.title)

#Filter the Reviews form current and former employees

#This will give you a df of all the reviews from current employees 
#current_employees <- filter(amazon_review, grepl("Current Employee", job.title))

#since we only need the number of employees, we can just count the rows of the resulting df.
current_employee_counts <- nrow(filter(amazon_review, grepl("Current Employee", job.title)))
former_employee_counts <- nrow(filter(amazon_review, grepl("Former Employee", job.title)))


sprintf("Current Employee %d", current_employee_counts)

#library(stringr)

# Split the job.title column 
job_title <- str_split_fixed(job_title$job.title, " - ",2)

# convert it to a dataframe
job_title <- data.frame(job_title)
# Rename the columns 
colnames(job_title) <- c("employee", "job.title")

job_title_counts <- plyr::count(job_title, var="job.title")
# Arrange the DF in accending order

###There are Amazon reviews from different states. What is the total number of reviews and average overall rating for each state.  

```{r}



#library(dplyr)

newData <- arrange(amazon_review, location)

# Select the 2 columns to work with, namely location and overall.ratings
newData <- select(newData, location, overall.ratings)

#library(stringr)
# Split the loaction column into two to get the city and the state separately
state_location <- str_split_fixed(newData$location, ",",2)

# Add the resulting DF into the the selected DF Above
newData <- cbind(newData, state_location)
# remove the old location column since we already have the split version
newData<- within(newData, rm(location))
#Rename the columns 
colnames(newData) <- c("overall.ratings", "location", "State")

#Group By state
state_counts <- group_by(newData, State)
# Summarize the grouped data and calculate the mean
